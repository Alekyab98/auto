Hi Team,

Quick update on my recent work
Last quarter:
Handled end-to-end work for Aether 5G data.includes
1. Data curation, building and validating data pipelines 
2. Ensured consistency between Grafana data and GCP data.
3. A major part of the effort on backfilling historic data, extracting from Grafana, and loading to BigQuery.

Current:
Working on the AUTOBI Network Genie Project, where I had earlier built around  11 super-curated tables. Currently, I'm working on below enhancements on  these tables 
1.Updating DAGs(migrating from daily to hourly)
2. Setting up data observability 
3. Documenting data lineage
